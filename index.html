                    is deeply passionate about guiding the youth, understanding that their actions, or lack thereof, can

                    educate, and propel young people toward their purpose. <br><br>

                    Sam has authored two books: "Activating Your Ears for Life and Purpose" (2021) and "Altitude
                    Insights" (2024).

                    He is married to his beautiful wife, Iyinyemi, who is actively involved in music ministry. Together,
